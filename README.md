## ðŸ›  For developer

1.  **Run project.**

    Install project and all required dependencies:

    ```shell
    cd project-directory/
    pnpm install
    ```

    Start develop server. The app will be visible on http://localhost:3000 (refreshing automaticaly after every change in the code).

    ```shell
    cd project-directory/
    pnpm dev
    ```

    You can always check locally if build is done correctly.

    ```shell
    cd project-directory/
    pnpm build
    ```

    Launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

    ```shell
    cd project-directory/
    pnpm test
    ```
